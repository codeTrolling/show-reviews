How to run: in order to run this app you need to have a few things installed:
MongoDb and Node.js
After you have installed them you need to go to the projects ```frontend``` folder, open a therminal there and type ```npm i```. This will install frontend related dependancies.
You need to do the same with the ```backend``` folder.
After that you need to run MongoDB by going to the folder where you have it installed and type ```mongod```. If you run into a problem regarding database location try specifiying the database path by using --dbpath: ```mongod --dbpath C:\YourPath```

After starting your MongoDB server you can run the backend with ```npm run devStart```
Then start the fronend with ```npm start```
